# PfAS_final_project
Goals: Given the stereo pair images of 3 types of objects (books, boxes, cups) passing through a conveyor (with and without occlusions) try to:
- Calibrate and rectify the stereo input.
- Process the input images to detect objects on the conveyor and track them in 3D, even under occlusions.
- Train a machine learning system that can classify unseen images into the 3 classes (cups, books and boxes) based either on 2D or 3D data. Use the web or/and capture your own images to create your training set. The image datasets provided with the project will constitute your testing set.

## Part 3: Classification 
In the folder Bag of Word it is present the code used to train and test the model and the relative dataset.
For the CNN you need to have and load the model to do the classification on test frames.
You can (hopefully) download the model from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Ici5VOCXmodtfbxUkUyBLedduvM0FJR/view?usp=sharing
